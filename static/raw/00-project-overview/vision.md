# The Vision

## The North Star

Build a complete open source enterprise technology ecosystem where:

- Any developer can pick one product and use it standalone in one command
- Any startup can use the full suite to build their company's tech stack from zero
- Any business domain has a production-ready reference implementation ready to fork
- An AI layer powers intelligence across all of it
- A business owner can think out loud and see software built, tested, deployed, and documented in real time

## The One Line

**"Think out loud. See it built."**

Everything else is a stepping stone toward this.

## What We're Building

### Layer 1 — Platform Products
Reusable building blocks that solve hard enterprise problems once, forever.

| Product | Tagline | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| iam-platform | Open source Okta — self-hosted enterprise IAM | 🔄 Active |
| auto-tracker | AI ticket automation for any project | ✅ Live |
| ai-debug-agent | AI error analysis, zero dependencies | ✅ Live |
| platform-docs | Self-writing documentation | 🔄 Active |
| platform-analytics | Dashboards without querying | ⏳ Planned |
| grc-bridge | Log and event API for GRC/SIEM tools | ⏳ Planned |
| pki-platform | Open source PKI and cryptography | ⏳ Planned |
| i18n-engine | Multilingual support for any project | ⏳ Planned |
| test-forge | PRD to TDD + BDD + screen recording | ⏳ Planned |
| platform-core | One command to run everything | ⏳ Planned |
| foundation-ai | LLM built from absolute zero | ⏳ Long term |

### Layer 2 — Domain Implementations
Real production-ready business implementations using platform products.

| Domain | What It Is | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| fintech-platform | Banking, payments, lending stack | ⏳ Planned |
| healthtech-platform | EHR, telehealth, pharmacy | ⏳ Planned |
| edtech-platform | LMS, assessments, certifications | ⏳ Planned |
| hrtech-platform | HRIS, payroll, recruiting | ⏳ Planned |
| ecommerce-platform | Storefront, inventory, orders | ⏳ Planned |
| legaltech-platform | Case management, contracts | ⏳ Planned |
| proptech-platform | Property management, listings | ⏳ Planned |
| logistics-platform | Supply chain, fleet, warehousing | ⏳ Planned |
| govtech-platform | Citizen services, permits, compliance | ⏳ Planned |

## Core Principles

### 1. Plug and Play
Every product works standalone. No hidden dependencies. One command install.

### 2. Zero Cost
Every product runs on free tiers or self-hosted open source tools. No vendor lock-in.

### 3. API First
Everything is exposed via REST API. Any external tool can integrate.

### 4. From Scratch Where It Matters
We build what we need to understand. No black boxes in critical paths.

### 5. Self-Documenting
The system documents itself. Human writes vision. Machine writes the rest.

### 6. Multilingual
Every product supports any human language from day one.

### 7. Open Source Everything
Every line of code is public. Anyone can fork, use, contribute.

## The GitHub Organisation Structure
```
pps-platform/          ← platform products (iam, auto-tracker, ai-debug-agent etc)
pps-domains/           ← domain implementations (fintech, healthtech etc)
pps-ai/                ← foundation-ai and AI research
```

Each org is like a separate company. Products in pps-platform are used by implementations in pps-domains. foundation-ai in pps-ai eventually powers everything.

## The Long Term Goal

A natural language operating system for building software:

1. Business owner describes what they want in plain English
2. test-forge generates requirements, BDD scenarios, test suites
3. Code is generated and reviewed
4. CI runs tests automatically
5. Screen recordings prove every user journey works
6. auto-tracker creates and moves tickets through the board
7. platform-docs writes the documentation
8. Everything deployed to production
9. ai-debug-agent monitors and self-heals
10. Business owner sees it all happen on screen

**Zero engineers needed for routine feature delivery.**

This is where foundation-ai leads. When we own the AI layer completely — trained on our own domain data, running on our own hardware — this becomes possible.
