# v0.1.0 — Foundation Release

## Release Date
February 22, 2026

## Summary
First working release of the IAM Platform. Core infrastructure established with SSO login working end-to-end.

## What's Included

### Infrastructure
- AWS EC2 t3.micro server provisioned
- Docker + Docker Compose installed
- Traefik reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt HTTPS
- PostgreSQL 15 database

### IAM Core
- Keycloak 23.0 deployed and configured

- RBAC roles created: `app-admin`, `app-user`, `app-readonly`
- Test user created (`testuser`)

### Frontend

- Served via Nginx through Traefik with HTTPS

### CI/CD

## Known Issues
- Using Let's Encrypt staging certificates (browser warning)

## Lessons Learned
- Oracle Cloud signup was blocked — migrated to AWS
