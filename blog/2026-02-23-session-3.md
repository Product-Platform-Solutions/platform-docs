## What We Did

Built a complete automated ticket tracking system from scratch.

### Accomplished
- Created `auto-tracker` and `ai-debug-agent` repositories
- Installed n8n (workflow automation) on AWS server
- Built GitHub Actions tracker workflow
- Built auto-tracker Express.js + TypeScript API
- Integrated Groq free tier (Llama 3.1 8B Instant) for AI enrichment
- Built rule-based enrichment engine (branch name parsing)
- Built GitHub Issues adapter
- Set up PM2 for API process management
- Created `platform-docs` with Docusaurus
- Wrote complete retroactive documentation

### Auto-tracker Flow
```
Git push → GitHub Actions → auto-tracker API → Groq AI enrichment → GitHub Issue
```

### AI Enrichment Example
Branch: `feat/IAM-004-add-ldap-federation`

Generated Issue:
- **Title:** "LDAP Federation Configuration"
- **Type:** Feature
- **Priority:** Medium  
- **Description:** Natural language description of the LDAP federation feature
- **Acceptance Criteria:** LDAP-specific checkboxes auto-generated

### Key Decisions
- Chose Groq over Claude API — free tier, no credit card
- Built custom API over pure n8n — more control, reusable
- Rule-based + AI hybrid — works without AI, better with it
- PM2 over Docker for API — simpler on single server

### Issues Encountered
- GitHub Actions exit code 60 — SSL cert issue, fixed with `-k` flag
- GitHub Actions exit code 28 — timeout, fixed with `--max-time 30`
- Groq model `llama3-8b-8192` deprecated — updated to `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
- n8n in separate docker-compose conflicted with main stack — consolidated

### Next Session
- MFA in Keycloak (TOTP)
- SCIM provisioning
- LDAP federation
- ai-debug-agent
- Kubernetes migration
