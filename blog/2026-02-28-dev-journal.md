## What We Did

The primary focus of the day was to lay the groundwork for the doc-engine project, which will play a crucial role in managing and generating documentation for our platform. Additionally, we addressed some compatibility issues in the iam-platform to ensure smooth integration with AI fetcher tools.

### Accomplished
- Initiated the doc-engine project with an initial commit, marking the beginning of our documentation management system.
- Enhanced the iam-platform by serving all /raw/ files and .md files as text/plain, thereby ensuring compatibility with AI fetcher tools.
- Updated the platform-docs repository with the daily dev journal entry for 2026-02-28, although there was a brief revert due to a minor oversight.

### Key Decisions
- Decided to prioritize the setup of the doc-engine to streamline our documentation process, recognizing its importance in maintaining a well-organized and accessible knowledge base.

### Issues Encountered
- None significant, other than a temporary revert in the platform-docs repository due to an error in the commit message, which was promptly corrected.

### Documentation Updates
- Updated the platform-docs with today's dev journal entry, which includes details of the progress made on the doc-engine and iam-platform projects.

### Next Session
- Continue developing the doc-engine to include features for automated documentation generation and management.
- Address the open issues in the iam-platform repository, particularly focusing on implementing and enhancing user authentication features using OAuth 2.0 and rule-based approaches.
