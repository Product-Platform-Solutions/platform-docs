## What We Did

Started from absolute zero. The goal: build an enterprise-grade IAM platform using only open source tools at zero cost.

### Accomplished
- Created GitHub organization `product-platform-solutions`
- Created `iam-platform` repository with proper branch structure
- Set up branch protection on `main`
- Scaffolded monorepo folder structure
- Created GitHub Actions CI pipeline (green ✅)
- Deployed Keycloak 23.0 with PostgreSQL backend
- Created `iam-platform` realm with client, roles, test user
- Verified SSO login working via Keycloak account console

### Key Decisions
- Chose Keycloak over Authentik — more complete enterprise feature set
- Used Docker Compose over bare metal — reproducible, portable
- Started with GitHub Issues over Jira — zero friction

### Issues Encountered
- Gitpod ran out of OCU credits mid-session
- Migrated to GitHub Codespaces
- Codespaces port visibility locked under org plan
- Exported Keycloak realm to JSON for version control

### Environment
- GitHub Codespaces (browser IDE)
- Docker-in-Docker devcontainer
- Keycloak running locally via Docker Compose
