What happened today was a mix of fixes, updates, and new beginnings across our open source platform project. I worked on resolving compatibility issues, made progress on our documentation, and started a new doc-engine project.

### iam-platform
The `iam-platform` repository saw two commits today, focused on serving files as `text/plain` for AI fetcher compatibility. The changes ensure that all `/raw/` files and `.md` files are served correctly. On the issues side, we still have open tickets related to updating and implementing user authentication, including moving to OAuth 2.0. These are crucial for enhancing platform security and will be a priority in the coming days.

### platform-docs
In `platform-docs`, there were a couple of commits related to the daily dev journal for this date. Initially, a draft was pushed, but it was soon reverted, and a corrected version was committed. This ensures our documentation remains accurate and up-to-date, reflecting the current state of our project.

### doc-engine
The `doc-engine` project is brand new, with its initial commit happening today. This marks the beginning of our effort to streamline and automate our documentation process, which will be essential for maintaining clarity and consistency across our project's documentation.

## Decisions & Notes
One of the key decisions made today was to prioritize the user authentication updates in `iam-platform`. This decision was based on the recognition of security as a foundational aspect of our platform.

## Up Next
Looking ahead, the plan is to dive deeper into resolving the open issues in `iam-platform`, particularly those related to user authentication. Additionally, we will continue to build out the `doc-engine` project, aiming to integrate it with our existing documentation workflow to improve efficiency and quality.
