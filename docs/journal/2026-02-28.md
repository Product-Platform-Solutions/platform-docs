## What happened today
Today was a productive Sunday, with commits across three of our repositories: `iam-platform`, `platform-docs`, and `doc-engine`. The focus was on compatibility fixes for the AI fetcher and laying the groundwork for new documentation tools.

## iam-platform
The `iam-platform` repository saw two commits aimed at enhancing compatibility with the AI fetcher. The first commit ensures that all files under the `/raw/` path are served as `text/plain`, while the second commit specifically addresses the serving of `.md` files as `text/plain`. These fixes are crucial for the seamless integration of AI fetcher functionalities. Open issues, including updates to the user authentication flow and the implementation of user authentication features, remain a priority for future development.

## platform-docs
In the `platform-docs` repository, there were two commits related to the daily dev journal for February 28, 2026. Initially, a draft was committed but later reverted, only to be recommitted with the necessary adjustments. This back-and-forth reflects the iterative process of refining our documentation to ensure clarity and accuracy.

## doc-engine
The `doc-engine` repository witnessed its initial commit today, marking the beginning of a new toolset aimed at streamlining our documentation processes. This is an exciting development, as it holds the promise of automating and enhancing how we create, manage, and update our project's documentation.

## Decisions & Notes
A key decision today was to prioritize the compatibility of our platforms with emerging technologies and tools, such as the AI fetcher. This aligns with our goal of maintaining a cutting-edge and adaptable open source platform.

## Up Next
Looking ahead, the focus will be on tackling the open issues in the `iam-platform`, particularly those related to user authentication. Additionally, the `doc-engine` will be further developed to support more efficient documentation management. With these efforts, we aim to bolster the security, usability, and maintainability of our project.
