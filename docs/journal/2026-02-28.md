Today was a productive Sunday, with progress made across multiple repositories. The focus was on compatibility fixes, documentation updates, and laying the groundwork for new features.

### iam-platform
The `iam-platform` repository saw two commits aimed at enhancing compatibility with AI fetchers. Specifically, changes were made to serve all `/raw/` files as `text/plain` and to serve `.md` files as `text/plain`. These updates will ensure seamless integration with AI tools. Meanwhile, issues related to user authentication, including the implementation of OAuth 2.0, remain open and are awaiting attention.

### platform-docs
In the `platform-docs` repository, there were two commits related to the daily dev journal for 2026-02-28. Initially, a draft was added, but it was subsequently reverted and then re-added, reflecting the iterative process of documentation refinement.

### doc-engine
The `doc-engine` repository witnessed its initial commit, marking the beginning of its development. This repository is expected to play a crucial role in documentation generation and management.

## Decisions & Notes
A key decision today was to prioritize the compatibility fixes for `iam-platform` to ensure AI fetcher compatibility, recognizing the importance of this feature for the platform's usability. The revert and re-commit in `platform-docs` highlight the importance of version control in managing documentation updates.

## Up Next
Tomorrow, the focus will shift towards addressing the open issues in `iam-platform`, particularly the implementation of user authentication features and the update to OAuth 2.0. Additionally, further development of `doc-engine` is anticipated, with plans to integrate it more closely with the documentation workflow.
