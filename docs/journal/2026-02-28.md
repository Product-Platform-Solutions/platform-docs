What happened today was a mix of resolving compatibility issues and laying the groundwork for new features. I worked on the `iam-platform`, `platform-docs`, and `doc-engine` repositories, focusing on fixes, documentation, and initial setups.

### iam-platform
The `iam-platform` repository saw two significant commits aimed at enhancing compatibility with AI fetchers. The first commit ensures that all files under the `/raw/` path are served as `text/plain`, which is crucial for seamless data fetching. The second commit specifically addresses the serving of `.md` files as `text/plain`, further enhancing compatibility. Despite these advancements, several issues remain open, including the need to update the user authentication flow to utilize OAuth 2.0 ([#19]), implement the user authentication feature ([#14]), and explore a rule-based approach for user authentication ([#13]).

### platform-docs and doc-engine
On the documentation front, I made a commit to `platform-docs` to include this daily dev journal, utilizing the `doc-engine` for markdown processing. Notably, the `doc-engine` repository received its initial commit, marking the beginning of its development. This engine is expected to play a critical role in how we manage and render documentation across the platform.

### Decisions & Notes
No significant decisions were made today, but it's clear that prioritizing the open issues in `iam-platform`, especially those related to user authentication, should be a focus in the coming days.

### Up Next
Tomorrow, I plan to dive deeper into addressing the open issues in `iam-platform`, starting with exploring OAuth 2.0 integration for user authentication. Additionally, further development of `doc-engine` is on the horizon, with the goal of streamlining our documentation processes.
