Today was a productive Sunday, with a focus on pushing forward with our open-source platform projects. Despite it being a weekend, the team made notable progress, addressing key compatibility issues and laying the groundwork for new features.

### iam-platform
The `iam-platform` repository saw two crucial commits aimed at enhancing compatibility with AI fetchers. The first commit ensured that all files under the `/raw/` directory are served as `text/plain`, which is essential for seamless integration with AI tools. A follow-up commit specifically targeted `.md` files, serving them as `text/plain` to maintain consistency across file types. These fixes are expected to improve the overall performance and usability of the platform. On the issues front, user authentication remains a priority, with three related issues (`#19`, `#14`, and `#13`) still open and awaiting resolution.

### doc-engine
In the `doc-engine` repository, an initial commit was made, marking the beginning of this new project. This foundational step sets the stage for further development and integration with other components of our open-source platform.

## Decisions & Notes
A key decision today involved prioritizing compatibility fixes to ensure that our platform can work smoothly with external AI tools. This decision aligns with our goal of providing a robust and adaptable solution.

## Up Next
Looking ahead, the focus will be on tackling the open issues in `iam-platform`, particularly those related to user authentication. Implementing OAuth 2.0 for the authentication flow is a high priority, and significant progress is expected in the coming days. For `doc-engine`, the next steps involve defining the project's scope, setting up the basic architecture, and planning the development roadmap.
