# v0.2.0 — Auto Tracker Release

## Auto-tracker Flow
```
Git push → GitHub Actions → auto-tracker API → Groq AI → GitHub Issue
```

## Known Issues

- n8n workflow and API are parallel (consolidation needed)
- GitHub Actions timeout set to 30s (may need tuning)

## Next Release (v0.3.0)

- ai-debug-agent
- Kubernetes migration (K3s)
